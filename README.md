# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns for Louise

## Project Overview
Client wishes to initiate a crowd funding campaign to finance her play, Fever. The estimated budget for Fever is $10,000.  

### Purpose
The objective of this work is to develop a strategic path-forward to yield a successful funding campaign.  This will be accomplished through the following tasks:
- Find source data to be used as effective comparison.  
- Retrieve data from repository.
- Clean data for purpose. 
- Analyzed data for trends.  
- Provide recommendations.  

## Analysis and Challenges
Data was extracted from Kickstarter.  Kickstarter is a funding platform for creative projects.  The data set included a total of 4,113 projects from an array of art forms including the following: 
- film & video/documentary
- technology/web
- music/jazz
- technology/wearables
- games/video games
- games/mobile games
- photography/photobooks
- food/food trucks
- theater/plays
- theater/musical
- theater/spaces

Data was parsed to include only projects with relevance to Loise's campaign -- Campaigns associated with Theater/Plays were specifically analyzed.  Variables of successful campaigns analyzed included the following: 
- deadline date
- launched date
- staff pick
- number of backers
- spotlight
- Aaverage donation per backer
- Year
- Financial Goal
- Amount Pledged
- Outcome (successful vs. unsuccessful)

Although multiple variables studied showed some impact on success, this study determeind to focus on the follwoing 2:  launch date and monetary goal

![Success_by_month.PNG](https://github.com/MikeHankinson/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/%25_Success_by_month.PNG)

- An analysis of 1,369 theater campaigns were studied to determine if funding launch date affected fundrasing success.   

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

![Outcomes_vs_Goals.PNG](https://github.com/MikeHankinson/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcomes_vs_Goals.PNG)

- An analysis of 1,047 play campaigns were studied to determine the effect of amount of fundraising goal on campaign success.   

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Note the root cause of success factors associated with both variables (outcomes based on goals and launch date) are undetermined with this sudy.   At this time, we do not fully understand why certain months have been found to be more successful for beginning fundraising campaigns.  

If needed, further work could be conducted to determine the "why" of our recommendations.  However, the cost of determining root causes provides little to the objective of the project as defined above.  

## Results

Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- By volume, campaigns beginning in the spring to early summer tend to be successful. 
- By % Successful metric, campaign success is fairly consistant through the year, outside of December, in which less than half of the campaigns met goals.  

Outcomes based on Funding Goals?
- In general, as funding goal requirements increase, percentage success decrease.  This, however, is not seen in the $35,000 to $45,000 range which seems to be a seet spot for intermediate funding requirements. 
- At this project´s funding requirement of $10,000, there appears to be a high level of success.  

Data limitations
- Again, with this data, we are able to see two factors that affect the success of a funding campaign.  However, we do not fully understand the root cause (or the why) for each success factor.   

Addition work 
- The ¨Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date¨ communicates that campaigns beginning in May or June have a higher number of successes.  However, it does not clearly show taht this is in part due to the fact of an increased numbers of campaigns started during this time frame.  Included above is a table demonstrating the % Success for each month.  This adds to the story.  
- Further investigation could be conducted to determine the "why" of our recommendations.
