# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns for Louise

## Project Overview
Client wishes to initiate a crowd funding campaign to finance her play, Fever. The estimated budget for Fever is $10,000.  

### Purpose
The objective of this work is to develop a strategic path-forward to yield a successful funding campaign.  This will be accomplished through the following tasks:
- Find source data to be used as effective comparison.  
- Retrieve data from repository.
- Clean data for purpose. 
- Analyzed data for trends.  
- Provide recommendations.  

## Analysis and Challenges
Data was extracted from Kickstarter.  Kickstarter is a funding platform for creative projects.  The data set included a total of 4,113 projects from an array of art forms including the following: 
- film & video/documentary
- technology/web
- music/jazz
- technology/wearables
- games/video games
- games/mobile games
- photography/photobooks
- food/food trucks
- theater/plays
- theater/musical
- theater/spaces

Data was parsed to include only projects with relevance to Loise's campaign -- Campaigns associated with Theater/Plays were specifically analyzed.  Variables of successful campaigns analyzed included the following: 
- deadline date
- launched date
- staff pick
- number of backers
- spotlight
- Aaverage donation per backer
- Year
- Financial Goal
- Amount Pledged
- Outcome (successful vs. unsuccessful)

Although multiple variables studied showed some impact on success, this study determeind to focus on the follwoing 2:  launch date and monetary goal


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.PNG](https://github.com/MikeHankinson/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.PNG)

- An analysis of 1,369 theater campaigns were studied to determine if funding launch date affected fundrasing success.   

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- An analysis of 1,047 play campaigns were studied to determine effect of amunt of fundraising goal on success of campaing.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Note the root cause of success factors associated with either variable (ourcomes based on goals and launch date) are undetermined with this sudy.   At his time, we do not fully know why certain months have found to be more successful for beginning fundraising campaigns.  

If needed, further work could be conducted to determine the "why" of our recommendations.  However, we recommend that the cost of determining root causes provides little to the objective to the project as defined above.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
